"""Text handling shared by the renderer and the QC gate.

* split_sentences: a line is rendered one sentence at a time. A countdown
  ("in 3... 2... 1...") stays in one sentence: rendered alone, a bare "2..."
  never came back word-exact from the ASR.
* speak_text: punctuation-only changes for the TTS prompt (a spaced hyphen
  or dash is a pause, never "minus"; a colon is a comma). Words never change.
* tts_prompt: what the model is actually given for one sentence - the
  sentence plus TAIL_PAD, so the model does not stop on the last phoneme;
  a closing countdown's "1..." becomes "1.".
* norm_words / word_errors: the word-exact ASR check. Numbers, a few
  spelling variants and ASR homophones are normalised; everything else
  must match exactly.
